# Music_MachineLearning
Data Analytics and Visualization Final Project

Creating an Environment for Deployment:

Step one: In your terminal create a new python virtual environment for us to use for running our app on with the following command: "conda create -n Spotify python=3.6"

Step two: Activate the environment in order to download our necessary libraries. "source activate Spotify"

Step three: Download the following libraries using "pip install": gunicorn, pyscopg2, flask, pandas. I will update this list if any other libraries are needed for the project.
